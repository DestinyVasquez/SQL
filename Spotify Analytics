# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Lastly, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#List the 5 most popular tracks 
SELECT popularity, track_name, id
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY BIT_DB.Spotifydata.popularity desc
LIMIT 5;

#List the 5 most popular artists 
SELECT popularity, artist_name, id
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY BIT_DB.Spotifydata.popularity desc
LIMIT 5;

#List the 5 most danceable tracks
SELECT DANCEABILITY, track_name, id
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY BIT_DB.Spotifydata.danceability desc
LIMIT 5;

#How many different artists are there listed?
SELECT COUNT (distinct artist_name)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

#SELECT artist and track avg popularity, danceability and energy
SELECT
artist_name
,track_name
,avg(popularity)
,avg(danceability)
,avg(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

#Calculate avg popularity for the artists in the spotify table
          #THEN for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, their avg popularity and label them as 'Top Star'.
WITH popularity_average_CTE AS
(SELECT avg(s.popularity) AS avg_popularity , s.artist_name
FROM Spotifydata s
GROUP BY s.artist_name)
SELECT avg_popularity AS 'Top Star', artist_name
FROM popularity_average_CTE
WHERE avg_popularity >=90;
